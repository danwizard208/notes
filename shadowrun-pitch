So I'm hoping to run an episodic Shadowrun campaign at Abby and Patrick's house.
Shadowrun is a tabletop RPG, like D&D, but with different rules and a different setting.
It's set in a dystopian near-future world with crazy technology AND magic.
If you're familiar with cyberpunk, it's a cyberpunk setting with d&d characters and abilities.
If you're not familiar with cyberpunk, think The Matrix (the first movie, not the rest),
especially everything until Neo takes the pill, and the stuff with the agents.
So it's that, plus Trolls and Gnomes, plus summoning water elementals and invading people's minds
(both with magic AND 5uper 1337 hax0rs).

The conventional way to run Shadowrun campaigns is a series of 'runs' or 'heists' - 
basically somebody will contact the group and give them a mission (almost always illegal)
and then the group does the mission. If we do it like that, then people can drop
in and out between runs.
Ideally we would try fo one run per session, but probably more like 2-3 sessions to finish a run.

If this is at all interesting to you, let me know, and we can schedule a character creation session.
I've got some ideas for how to run character creation to make it at least as much fun
(if not more) as a game session.
