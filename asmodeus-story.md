It was a bright and sunny day as Edward, first son of Richard and Sofia and
Heir to House MonteVerde, watched the servants play outside.
It was a good day to lazily waste playing in the sun, but Edward had
more important activities in mind. Father was away on Important Business
(leaving with his customary resigned "For the Good of the Family" look),
and Mother was Maintaining Appearances and Socializing In Court
(Mother always seemed to have significantly more fun at her meetings than Father;
Edward just wished she didn't arrange for him to meet so many dreadfully boring
girls every time she went), so it was an ideal opportunity to
go prowl the deeper reaches of the library. Of course, at 11 years of age,
he was now officially granted access to all parts of the library, but Father
and Mother always gave him such Looks whenever he attempted to read anything
*interesting*.

With a whispered incantation and a wave of his hands, Edward created an illusion
of himself continuing to stare out the window in the mind of his chaperone and
slipped away (Minor Illusion had been the first spell he'd learned 3 years ago,
and it remained the most useful thing he'd ever learned).
Then he was off, past the great petrified oak doors guarding the library,
through the towering stacks that comprised House MonteVerdes trove of knowledge,
past the padlocked black gate for which he now had the key, and into the furthest
corner, where hardly any sun could reach. Edward had been disapointed to learn
there weren't any great and terrible books of magic in The Corner
(although he still secretly hoped that Mother and Father were just holding out
on him and were waiting to show him the *really* good stuff when he was older)
but that didn't matter right now. What mattered was that he'd found the book
he'd been dying to read, the book at the heart of all Mother's quotes and
many of Father's bedtime stories, but that they were reluctant to let him read
in its entirety.

### The Devil King



----

OOC Afterword: The protagonist of __The Devil King__ is a legendarily cunning
and ambitious man who started life as a street urchin and became king of one
of the greatest empires on Home Sphere, and acheived many amazing feats of
greatness as ruler. It's unclear if the man was myth or reality, and the situation
is made worse by the many conflicting accounts of his deeds. The sources all
seem to agree though that he was known as Asmodeus in life; they disagree on
whether he took the name himself, was called thus by his subjects who saw him
as a tyrant, or if this was merely an appelation meant to imply that he gained
his greatness from a pact made with devils (perhaps with the King of Devils himself).
